        "INFLAMMATORY LANGUAGE\n",
        "=====================\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Name-Calling\n",
        "Definition: Using a loaded positive or negative label to shape how the audience feels about a person, group, or idea.\n",
        "Instead of providing evidence, the speaker uses emotionally charged wording to discredit or glorify.\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "- “The movement, composed largely of radical extremists, has demanded sweeping reform.”\n",
        "- “Big-money interests continue to profit during the crisis.”\n",
        "- “The oft-labeled terrorist sympathizers took to the streets in the latest wave of protests.”\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Demonization\n",
        "Definition: Describing people or groups as evil, dangerous, corrupt, disgusting, or less than human.\n",
        "The goal is to turn the audience against the target by making them sound like a threat to society.\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "- “The nation’s bureaucrats are bleeding taxpayers dry.”\n",
        "- “Migrants are parasites stealing American jobs.”\n",
        "- “These politicians are eating away at the heart of this nation from within.”\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Scapegoating\n",
        "Definition: Blaming an entire group for a broad problem or crisis. The group is framed as the main cause of widespread harm or decline.\n",
        "This almost always targets groups (not individuals) and links them to larger social, economic, or moral problems.\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "- “The rising rents — driven as always by greedy landlords — represent a severe strain on families.”\n",
        "- “Teachers’ unions are the reason kids are failing in school.”\n",
        "- “Homelessness continues to rise because city officials refuse to enforce basic laws.”\n",

        "1. Exaggeration\n",
        "Definition: When something is made to sound artificially much bigger, better, or worse than it really is —\n",
        "or, the opposite, made to sound smaller or less serious than it actually is.\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "- “A local protest ignited waves of outrage and sent shockwaves through the nation.”\n",
        "- “This minor disagreement has become a national catastrophe, easily the worst of the modern era.”\n",
        "- “The present scandal is nothing — just political theater — and most Americans aren’t even aware of it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Slogans\n",
        "Definition: A short, memorable phrase used to spark emotion or support a cause.\n",
        "Slogans simplify complex ideas into a few words and can promote unity, nationalism, or other sentiments.\n",
        "They can be positive or negative in tone.\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "- “Make America Great Again” / “America First”\n",
        "- “No Justice, No Peace”\n",
        "- “Occupy Wall Street — We Are the 99%.”\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Bandwagon\n",
        "Definition: When people are told to support something just because “everyone else” already supports it.\n",
        "The message is that if many others believe it, you should too. This relies on social pressure and popularity, not evidence.\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "- “Most Americans back this plan, polls show.”\n",
        "- “As the Senator emphasized, ‘every true Republican supports this cause.’”\n",
        "- “No serious economist still believes raising taxes is a good idea.”\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Causal Oversimplification\n",
        "Definition: When a complex issue is blamed on just one cause or explained with one simple answer,\n",
        "ignoring all the other factors that are probably involved.\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "- “The media is the only reason the nation is divided.”\n",
        "- “Inflation rose solely because of the president’s policies.”\n",
        "- “Crime is up because of progressive prosecutors.”\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Doubt\n",
        "Definition: Language that tries to make the audience question whether a person, group, or institution is competent, honest, or legitimate.\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "- “Is he really ready to be the Mayor?”\n",
        "- “Is this leader even capable of running the country?”\n",
        "- “Some experts question whether the agency’s data can be trusted.”\n",

        "*   **Enhanced Paragraph Parsing**: The `build_article_text` function has been successfully updated. It now leverages a helper function, `split_article_into_paragraphs`, to split article bodies into enumerated paragraphs. This provides a structured view (e.g., \"Paragraph 0: ...\") for LLMs and returns a separate list of raw paragraphs, fulfilling the requirement for robust paragraph indexing.\n",
        "*   **Prompt Standardization for Paragraph Indexing**: The `build_user_prompt_for_annotation` function was modified to explicitly instruct annotator LLMs to:\n",
        "    *   Always include a `paragraphIndex` for every annotation.\n",
        "    *   Ensure every enumerated paragraph receives at least one annotation.\n",
        "    *   Apply a default \"No Polarizing language\" annotation if no other relevant annotation is found for a paragraph, guaranteeing complete coverage.\n",
        "*   **Automated Annotation Completeness Check**: A new utility function, `post_process_annotations`, was developed and integrated into all annotator functions (`annotate_with_openai_A`, `annotate_with_gemini_B`, `annotate_with_openai_C`). This function automatically inserts \"No Polarizing language\" annotations for any paragraphs that the LLMs might have missed, thereby guaranteeing that every paragraph has at least one associated annotation.\n",
        "*   **Paragraph-Aware Adjudication**: The `adjudicate_with_openai` function's system and user prompts were updated to guide the adjudicator LLM in considering the `paragraphIndex`. Instructions now ensure that the adjudicator consolidates annotations effectively, covers every paragraph, and coalesces multiple \"No Polarizing language\" annotations for the same paragraph into a single entry in the final output.\n",
        "*   **Critical Input File Missing**: Despite the successful implementation of the annotation pipeline enhancements, the overall execution was halted by a `FileNotFoundError` for `twelve_article_set.csv`. This prevented the full annotation process from running, but clear instructions were provided to the user for uploading the necessary file.\n",

        "*   The immediate next step is for the user to upload the `twelve_article_set.csv` file to the `/content/` directory. Once the file is present, the re-engineered annotation and adjudication process can be fully executed and validated.\n"
