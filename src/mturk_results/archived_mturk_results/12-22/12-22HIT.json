Ames and Harper said they were driving their girls to a babysitter when police approached them in an apartment complex parking lot. Williams said Sunday that they fled from police after a Family Dollar manager alerted authorities to \"adults\" stealing from the store. In a police report, officers said the girl took a boxed doll, while Ames took a pair of underwear and a woman who'd been with the couple at the dollar store also allegedly stole something.

Williams said Sunday that police \"shouldn't have reacted the way that we reacted.\" Williams said that the officers who appeared in the video were placed on desk duty. An internal investigation was looking at discrepancies between the police report that documented the incident and the cell phone video that showed the confrontation. On Saturday, Ames told Al Sharpton on MSNBC that he was glad the incident was caught on video by a bystander so people could see how he and his family were treated. \"I felt like I did everything I could to show the officer that I was complying,\" he said, adding that the experience was traumatizing for him and his young children. \"I looked the barrel in the eyes, my kids looked the barrel in the eyes.\n\nInflammatory Language\nPersuasive Propaganda\nNo polarizing language\n\nInstructions\nYou will annotate 1 news article.

Phrases suggesting the technology reveals things “not visible to the naked eye,” or claims that it could “map the whole Earth every 12 days,” tended to create an exaggerated impression of the system’s capabilities.

Conversely, words like \"excellent,\" \"loved it,\" or \"highly recommend\" would indicate a positive tone.\nTone Choices: The overall sentiment is analyzed. A model might detect sarcasm, urgency, politeness, or aggression through the combination of words, punctuation, and sentence structure. For example, excessive use of exclamation points or all caps often indicates strong emotion or urgency.\nFraming Choices: The way an argument is structured can influence classification. A persuasive piece might use rhetorical questions, appeals to emotion, or evidence-based arguments, while an informational piece would be more objective and direct.\nEmotional Wording: The presence of language that evokes strong feelings (e.g., \"heartbreaking,\" \"furious,\" \"delighted\") directly informs emotional tagging.\nExamples: Specific examples used within the text provide context that helps the model understand the subject matter and the user's intent.

The first reversal of environmental policies by a major European city comes despite soaring global environmental concerns and is a fresh sign of growing divisions in Spain after a series of inconclusive elections in April and May. Last November Madrid's then far-left government banned most petrol and diesel cars from its center to tackle high levels of nitrogen dioxide. The policy was known as \"Madrid central\" and it was intended to bring Madrid into line with EU clean air rules which it had been violating since 2010. \"Yes we can, I do want Madrid central,\" chanted the protesters. Some were holding banners that read \"I want to breathe free\" and \"We aspire to have a Madrid without smoke\".\n\n\"We have to save (the planet) starting at the local and small level, the first thing is Madrid's center,\" said Laura Martin, a 39-year-old actress. She added that she was concerned that the new Madrid government might have some similar ideas to U.S. President Donald Trump's rollback of environmental policies, such as weakening rules limiting carbon emissions from power plants and standards on harmful gas emissions from cars and trucks. People of all ages rallied despite a scorching heatwave in Spain and most of Europe, which had already forced the city of Paris to ban more than half of all registered cars from its roads earlier this week because the heat worsens pollution. Various European cities including Paris, Hamburg, Amsterdam, London and Oslo have started to penalize or ban older polluting cars as they seek to phase out all fossil fuel cars in the coming decade. Environmental groups including Greenpeace say the \"Madrid central\" measure slashed air pollution levels from car emissions in the center to record lows.\n\nSubmit & show next paragraph\nInflammatory Language\nPersuasive Propaganda\nNo polarizing language\n\nPersuasive_Propaganda\n\nSelect a Subcategory\nAnnotated Text Excerpts:"

Video showed officers appearing to push and kick a handcuffed man believed to be Ames and handcuffing Harper, who is pregnant, after an unidentified woman came to take care of the couples' two young daughters. At one point, an officer screams at Ames and says: \"\"When I tell you to do something, you f------ do it!\" The officers then pick up Ames who apologizes and appears to be complying and throws him against a police vehicle. The couple and authorities offered different accounts of what happened before the confrontation. Ames and Harper said they were driving their girls to a babysitter when police approached them in an apartment complex parking lot. Williams said Sunday that they fled from police after a Family Dollar manager alerted authorities to \"adults\" stealing from the store. In a police report, officers said the girl took a boxed doll, while Ames took a pair of underwear and a woman who'd been with the couple at the dollar store also allegedly stole something. Once the car was parked, the report says, Ames allegedly reached toward the car's center console and yelled that he hadn't done anything wrong. Williams said Sunday that police \"shouldn't have reacted the way that we reacted.\" Williams said that the officers who appeared in the video were placed on desk duty. An internal investigation was looking at discrepancies between the police report that documented the incident and the cell phone video that showed the confrontation. On Saturday, Ames told Al Sharpton on MSNBC that he was glad the incident was caught on video by a bystander so people could see how he and his family were treated. "

Donald Schupek, 79, who served three terms as mayor of the south suburb before losing a reelection bid in 2017, admitted under oath that in 2015 he had drawn checks on the village's bank account to give himself payroll advances that he never intended to deduct from future paychecks or repay. Prosecutors, who allege Schupek used the ill-gotten gains to gamble at casinos in Joliet, recommended a prison sentence of six and 12 months for the former mayor, who is in poor health and appeared in court Thursday using a wheelchair. By statute, U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman can sentence Schupek to as many as 10 years behind bars but the former mayor's attorney said he expects the judge to impose a much lighter sentence, possibly probation. Schupek declined comment outside the courtroom Thursday after entering his guilty plea."
