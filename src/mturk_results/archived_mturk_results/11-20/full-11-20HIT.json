        "openFeedback": "I tagged the selected text as containing no flame rhetoric or persuasive propaganda because it presents the information in a neutral, fact-based, and balanced manner. Here’s what made it stand out:\n\nTone and Language:\nThe article uses measured, professional language without emotional exaggeration, slurs, or sarcasm. Phrases like “resisted taking the witness stand” and “subpoenas compelling Mueller to appear” describe events plainly, not provocatively.\n\nBalanced Presentation of Political Sides:\nIt fairly represents both Democratic and Republican perspectives. For example:\n\n“Democrats eager to employ him to build a case…”\n\n“Republicans eager to argue for the president’s innocence…”\nThis dual mention avoids the bias typical of propaganda.\n\nFactual Structure:\nThe passage sticks to verifiable details—dates, names, official actions (like subpoenas), and historical context (Mueller's past public silence). There’s no use of emotionally charged or misleading phrasing.\n\nNo Call to Action or Manipulation:\nPropaganda often includes persuasive devices, like appeals to fear, nationalism, or morality. This excerpt lacks such cues and instead reads like informational reporting."

In the end, the two committees were forced to issue subpoenas compelling Mueller to appear. The chairmen of the panels, Representatives Jerrold Nadler of New York and Adam Schiff of California, wrote in a letter to Mueller on Tuesday that they understood he had reservations about appearing on Capitol Hill, but they were insistent he do so, anyway.\n\n\"The American public deserves to hear directly from you about your investigation and conclusions,\" the chairmen wrote. \"We will work with you to address legitimate concerns about preserving the integrity of your work, but we expect that you will appear before our committees as scheduled.\" The White House declined to comment Tuesday night. Schiff told reporters shortly after the announcement that he expected his committee to meet privately with members of Mueller's staff after his testimony to answer additional questions. As special counsel, Mueller employed a large team of prosecutors and FBI agents whose detailed knowledge of the case could be as valuable to House investigators as Mueller's public statements. It was not immediately clear which committee Mueller would appear before first on July 17, though a copy of the subpoena issued by Nadler indicated that he was to show up before the Judiciary Committee at 9 a.m. The committee leaders have been under intense pressure from Democratic activists and their own rank-and-file members alike to secure an appearance by Mueller.\n\nBoth Nadler and Schiff initially invited the special counsel to testify voluntarily in April, but discussions proved thorny and protracted. Mueller and his team of prosecutors wanted to avoid a public spectacle, asked to limit his remarks to closed sessions with lawmakers and insisted that their 448-page report would best speak for itself. As of now, it does not appear that Mueller will participate in a hearing before the Republican-controlled Senate, where lawmakers in the majority were less insistent he appear.

          "text": "Atlanta Mayor Endorses Joe Biden for President\nATLANTA -- Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms has endorsed Democrat Joe Biden for president. Bottoms was a guest of Biden's during Thursday night's Democrat debate, a debate in which some observers are calling a poor showing from the former vice president. Bottoms informed the Associated Press of her endorsement prior to her formal announcement, set for later Friday. Biden appeared with several other Democrats during Thursday night's debate, along with U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand. Harris, who is black, challenged Biden to explain his decades-old position with respect to school desegregation, one which she characterized as being against busing. \"I did not oppose busing in America. What I opposed was busing ordered by the Department of Education,\" Biden countered. Harris, the former prosecutor turned California senator, said she didn't think the former vice president \"was a racist.\" But she criticized him for recently \"defending segregationists\" in the Senate and for once opposing mandatory busing of students to desegregated public schools.\n\nHarris described a young girl in the 1970s who boarded such buses before dramatically offering, \"That little girl was me.\" The moment was as powerful as it was unexpected, a searing line of attack against Biden, who served as vice president to the first black president. Biden entered back-to-back nights of Democratic presidential debates in Miami as the leading Democratic candidate. In deeply personal tones, Harris hammered Biden for policy choices that she suggested betrayed the spirit of the civil rights movement, if not directly opposing all it stood for. Then she really hit her stride, exhibiting the controlled force of a practiced cross-examiner. \"Do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America?\" Harris asked. A visibly angry Biden responded that his record was mischaracterized. But he was left denying Harris' comments on a technicality, saying he didn't oppose public school busing, just it being ordered by the Department of Education decrying federal intervention on the issue on behalf of states.\n\nHarris shot back, \"There are moments in history where states fail to support the civil rights of people.\" Biden offered only curt responses after that and was so flustered that he failed to lean on his time as Barack Obama's vice president seeming unsure of himself for prolonged stretches on national television. Senior advisers to Biden insisted afterward that they weren't surprised by the confrontation with Harris and were satisfied with his response in the time allowed. They noted that while he dismissed Harris' characterization of his relationship with segregationist senators in his early years in the Senate more than 45 years ago, Biden appeared to be listening while she criticized his position on busing. A total of 20 presidential candidates took the stage over the course of the two nights 10 candidates on Wednesday and another 10 on Thursday. All 10 of the candidates on Thursday's stage raised their hands when NBC's Savannah Guthrie asked if they would support providing health care for the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants.\n\nWhile touting the diversity of their party, some of the younger candidates suggested it may be time for the older generation of leaders to pass the torch, a clear dig aimed at the 76-year-old Biden. The Associated Press contributed to this report."

Video showed officers appearing to push and kick a handcuffed man believed to be Ames and handcuffing Harper, who is pregnant, after an unidentified woman came to take care of the couples' two young daughters. At one point, an officer screams at Ames and says: \"\"When I tell you to do something, you f------ do it!\" The officers then pick up Ames who apologizes and appears to be complying and throws him against a police vehicle. The couple and authorities offered different accounts of what happened before the confrontation. Ames and Harper said they were driving their girls to a babysitter when police approached them in an apartment complex parking lot. Williams said Sunday that they fled from police after a Family Dollar manager alerted authorities to \"adults\" stealing from the store. In a police report, officers said the girl took a boxed doll, while Ames took a pair of underwear and a woman who'd been with the couple at the dollar store also allegedly stole something. Once the car was parked, the report says, Ames allegedly reached toward the car's center console and yelled that he hadn't done anything wrong. Williams said Sunday that police \"shouldn't have reacted the way that we reacted.\" Williams said that the officers who appeared in the video were placed on desk duty. An internal investigation was looking at discrepancies between the police report that documented the incident and the cell phone video that showed the confrontation. On Saturday, Ames told Al Sharpton on MSNBC that he was glad the incident was caught on video by a bystander so people could see how he and his family were treated. \"I felt like I did everything I could to show the officer that I was complying,\" he said, adding that the experience was traumatizing for him and his young children. \"I looked the barrel in the eyes, my kids looked the barrel in the eyes.",

Direct quotes from both Democratic and Republican figures are included, offering balanced representation of both parties without editorializing or implying judgment.\n\nThere’s no clear attempt to evoke strong emotions, push a political viewpoint, or frame individuals or parties in a negative or exaggerated way.

          "text": "Democrat Robert Martwick Sworn in as State Senator; GOP Taps Rosemont Mayor Brad Stephens for House Seat\nJun. 29--Two familiar names will be taking on new roles representing residents of the Northwest Side and near northwest suburbs in Springfield. Robert Martwick, a Chicago Democrat who's served in the Illinois House since 2013, was sworn in Friday afternoon as the new state senator for the 10th District. Local Democratic committeemen, including Martwick himself, selected him to replace former Sen. John Mulroe, a Chicago Democrat who stepped down earlier this month after being appointed a Cook County judge. Local Republican leaders met Saturday to name Rosemont Mayor Brad Stephens to a House seat vacated by Michael McAuliffe, who had been the lone GOP state lawmaker from Chicago. McAuliffe retired June 17 after 23 years in the legislature. His father, Roger McAuliffe, held the seat for 23 years before that. Stephens, the son of longtime Rosemont Mayor Donald Stephens, was sworn in by Mulroe. Stephens said Friday that he will continue serving as mayor and will collect his legislative salary of more than $69,000 on top of his $260,000 mayoral salary.\n\nHe said he will comply with a state law prohibiting local officials from being paid by local governments for the time they're in session in Springfield. Stephens, who will represent roughly the western half of Martwick's Senate district, said he already has good working relationships with the new senator and other lawmakers. \"Over the past 12 years as the mayor, I've made several trips to the Capitol to forge relationships with members on both sides of the aisle,\" Stephens said. He said believes he'll be able to find common ground on some issues with the Democrats who control the legislature. House Republican leader Jim Durkin of Western Springs welcomed Stephens to the House. \"Brad Stephens will be able to deliver for his district on day one,\" Durkin said Saturday in a statement. \"His deep knowledge of state policy and its impact on local communities will be valuable to the Illinois state legislature and a welcome addition to the House Republican Caucus.\" Martwick this spring shepherded one of Democratic Gov.",

Prosecutors, who allege Schupek used the ill-gotten gains to gamble at casinos in Joliet, recommended a prison sentence of six and 12 months for the former mayor, who is in poor health and appeared in court Thursday using a wheelchair. By statute, U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman can sentence Schupek to as many as 10 years behind bars but the former mayor's attorney said he expects the judge to impose a much lighter sentence, possibly probation.

The article heavily relies on the perspective of the Harbor Performance Enhancement Center, and the most vivid, emotionally charged language comes directly from their legal complaint and their CEO's statements.\n\nSpecific phrases that stood out include the direct quote, \"they [ILWU] run the Port,\" which I tagged as inflammatory and demonizing. This is a powerful, informal accusation that suggests a single entity holds improper, undemocratic control over a public infrastructure asset. It's designed to provoke an emotional response of unfairness in the reader.\n\nFurthermore, the CEO's statement that the union's demands were an \"unexpected curveball thrown at us\" uses a vivid, informal metaphor that frames the company as the victim of an unfair tactic, injecting a sense of frustration and grievance into an otherwise factual report.\n\nFinally, the CEO's comment that the project was \"stymied by a single entity for their own narrow reasons\" is a clear example of persuasive propaganda and vilification. It simplifies a complex labor and business negotiation into a story of a virtuous \"green, job-creating project\" being blocked by a selfish, monolithic villain. This framing is intentionally one-sided, persuading the reader to sympathize with the company without presenting the union's potential justification for its demands. The article's bias lies in showcasing this persuasive language from one side without providing a counter-narrative or the union's reasoning."

Williams said Sunday that police \"shouldn't have reacted the way that we reacted.\" Williams said that the officers who appeared in the video were placed on desk duty. An internal investigation was looking at discrepancies between the police report that documented the incident and the cell phone video that showed the confrontation. On Saturday, Ames told Al Sharpton on MSNBC that he was glad the incident was caught on video by a bystander so people could see how he and his family were treated. \"I felt like I did everything I could to show the officer that I was complying,\" he said, adding that the experience was traumatizing for him and his young children. \"I looked the barrel in the eyes, my kids looked the barrel in the eyes.\n\nInflammatory Language\nPersuasive Propaganda\nNo polarizing language\n\nInstructions\nYou will annotate 1 news article.
