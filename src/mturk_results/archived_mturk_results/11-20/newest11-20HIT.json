Ames and Harper said they were driving their girls to a babysitter when police approached them in an apartment complex parking lot. Williams said Sunday that they fled from police after a Family Dollar manager alerted authorities to \"adults\" stealing from the store. In a police report, officers said the girl took a boxed doll, while Ames took a pair of underwear and a woman who'd been with the couple at the dollar store also allegedly stole something.

Williams said Sunday that police \"shouldn't have reacted the way that we reacted.\" Williams said that the officers who appeared in the video were placed on desk duty. An internal investigation was looking at discrepancies between the police report that documented the incident and the cell phone video that showed the confrontation. On Saturday, Ames told Al Sharpton on MSNBC that he was glad the incident was caught on video by a bystander so people could see how he and his family were treated. \"I felt like I did everything I could to show the officer that I was complying,\" he said, adding that the experience was traumatizing for him and his young children. \"I looked the barrel in the eyes, my kids looked the barrel in the eyes.\n\nInflammatory Language\nPersuasive Propaganda\nNo polarizing language\n\nInstructions\nYou will annotate 1 news article.

Phrases suggesting the technology reveals things “not visible to the naked eye,” or claims that it could “map the whole Earth every 12 days,” tended to create an exaggerated impression of the system’s capabilities.
