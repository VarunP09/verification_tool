Democrat Robert Martwick sworn in as state senator; GOP taps Rosemont Mayor Brad Stephens for House seat,"Jun. 29--Two familiar names will be taking on new roles representing residents of the Northwest Side and near northwest suburbs in Springfield. Robert Martwick, a Chicago Democrat who's served in the Illinois House since 2013, was sworn in Friday afternoon as the new state senator for the 10th District. Local Democratic committeemen, including Martwick himself, selected him to replace former Sen. John Mulroe, a Chicago Democrat who stepped down earlier this month after being appointed a Cook County judge. Local Republican leaders met Saturday to name Rosemont Mayor Brad Stephens to a House seat vacated by Michael McAuliffe, who had been the lone GOP state lawmaker from Chicago. McAuliffe retired June 17 after 23 years in the legislature. His father, Roger McAuliffe, held the seat for 23 years before that. Stephens, the son of longtime Rosemont Mayor Donald Stephens, was sworn in by Mulroe. Stephens said Friday that he will continue serving as mayor and will collect his legislative salary of more than $69,000 on top of his $260,000 mayoral salary.\nHe said he will comply with a state law prohibiting local officials from being paid by local governments for the time they're in session in Springfield. Stephens, who will represent roughly the western half of Martwick's Senate district, said he already has good working relationships with the new senator and other lawmakers. ""Over the past 12 years as the mayor, I've made several trips to the Capitol to forge relationships with members on both sides of the aisle,"" Stephens said. He said believes he'll be able to find common ground on some issues with the Democrats who control the legislature. House Republican leader Jim Durkin of Western Springs welcomed Stephens to the House. ""Brad Stephens will be able to deliver for his district on day one,"" Durkin said Saturday in a statement. ""His deep knowledge of state policy and its impact on local communities will be valuable to the Illinois state legislature and a welcome addition to the House Republican Caucus."" Martwick this spring shepherded one of Democratic Gov.\nJ.B. Pritzker's signature initiatives -- a proposed amendment to do away with the Illinois Constitution's flat-rate income tax mandate -- through the House. The measure will appear on the November 2020 ballot, when Martwick said he plans to seek a full term in the Senate. In the Senate, Martwick will continue pushing for legislation to create an elected school board in Chicago, he said. The House approved a bill he sponsored with broad bipartisan support in April, but it was put on hold in the Senate in deference to new Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who called the proposal for a 21-member board ""unwieldy."" Martwick said he's yet to met with Lightfoot to discuss the issue. ""I look forward to sitting down with her and having a conversation in earnest,"" he said. Stephens said he also plans to seek a full term in 2020, but Democrats will likely have their eyes on the seat as well.\nThough McAuliffe ran unopposed last year, his reelection race against Democrat Merry Marwig in 2016 was one of the most expensive state legislative campaigns in the country. ""We will do whatever it takes to win,"" Stephens said. In addition to looking for potential candidates to challenge Stephens next year, Democratic leaders also must select Martwick's replacement in the House. Among the potential candidates are former 45th Ward Ald. John Arena and former WGN-AM 720 host Patti Vasquez. Martwick has not yet backed a successor. dpetrella@chicagotribune.com ___ (c)2019 the Chicago Tribune Visit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",politics,Chicago Tribune,center
"Frozen sperm bank could be set up in space, study suggests","Sperm banks could one day be set up in space, scientists have predicted. Frozen samples that were exposed to microgravity conditions and those kept in normal conditions appear to keep similar characteristics, according to the results of a small study, the Press Association has reported. The results of the research suggest frozen sperm could be sent into space and ""open the possibility of creating a human sperm bank outside of Earth"". But more research is needed to fully understand the effect of space conditions, scientists have said. The study was presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology annual meeting in Vienna, Austria. The scientists conducting the study said little is known about the effect of different gravity levels on sperm. Dr Montserrat Boada, from Dexeus Women's Health in Barcelona, said: ""Some studies suggest a significant decrease in the motility of human fresh sperm sample. ""But nothing has been reported on the possible effects of gravitational differences on frozen human gametes, in which state they could be transported from Earth to space."" The researchers used sperm from 10 healthy donors, exposing some of the samples to microgravity using a small aerobatic aircraft. The samples were then analyzed for concentration, motility and DNA fragmentation - tests which are all performed to check for fertility. No significant differences were found between the samples kept on the ground and those exposed to microgravity, according to the study. ""The lack of differences observed in the sperm characteristics between frozen samples exposed to microgravity and those maintained in ground conditions open the possibility of safely transporting male gametes to space and considering the possibility of creating a human sperm bank outside of Earth,"" the researchers said. However they added that this is a preliminary study, and they need to validate their findings with more samples and expose the sperm to space-like conditions for longer periods of time. ""Our best option will be to perform the experiment using real spaceflight but access is very limited,"" Dr Boada said.",science,Press Association,center
phoenix chief says police response to incident with 4-year-old is 'unacceptable',"Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams apologized for her department's handling of an alleged shoplifting incident involving a 4-year-old girl and her parents , saying Sunday the confrontation that was captured on video was ""unacceptable."" ""What we saw in that video isn't in keeping with good policing,"" Williams said in an interview with NBC affiliate KPNX . ""This is not what should have happened in that circumstance."" The child's parents, Dravon Ames and Iesha Harper, filed notice of a $10 million claim last week over the incident, which occurred on May 29 after the couple said they realized their daughter had taken a doll from a dollar store. Video showed officers appearing to push and kick a handcuffed man believed to be Ames and handcuffing Harper, who is pregnant, after an unidentified woman came to take care of the couples' two young daughters. At one point, an officer screams at Ames and says: """"When I tell you to do something, you f------ do it!"" The officers then pick up Ames who apologizes and appears to be complying and throws him against a police vehicle. The couple and authorities offered different accounts of what happened before the confrontation. Ames and Harper said they were driving their girls to a babysitter when police approached them in an apartment complex parking lot. Williams said Sunday that they fled from police after a Family Dollar manager alerted authorities to ""adults"" stealing from the store. In a police report, officers said the girl took a boxed doll, while Ames took a pair of underwear and a woman who'd been with the couple at the dollar store also allegedly stole something. Once the car was parked, the report says, Ames allegedly reached toward the car's center console and yelled that he hadn't done anything wrong. Williams said Sunday that police ""shouldn't have reacted the way that we reacted."" Williams said that the officers who appeared in the video were placed on desk duty. An internal investigation was looking at discrepancies between the police report that documented the incident and the cell phone video that showed the confrontation. On Saturday, Ames told Al Sharpton on MSNBC that he was glad the incident was caught on video by a bystander so people could see how he and his family were treated. ""I felt like I did everything I could to show the officer that I was complying,"" he said, adding that the experience was traumatizing for him and his young children. ""I looked the barrel in the eyes, my kids looked the barrel in the eyes.\nI thought they were gonna start shooting,"" he said. Rev. Jarrett Maupin, of the Arizona chapter of the National Action Network, appeared with Ames on MSNBC, saying that ""this is one of the most insane attacks on a black family, or any family, that I've ever seen law enforcement engage in."" Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego issued a statement on Twitter Saturday saying about the incident, saying, ""I, like many others, am sick over what I have seen in the video"" and ""I am deeply sorry for what this family went through."" The mayor vowed to speed up implementation of body cameras on police officers and hold a community meeting to address the incident. ""I realize that to get to the bottom of this issue and implement meaningful change, we are going to have some uncomfortable and painful conversations,"" Gallego said.",crime,CNN,left
"Four top residencies now offered to local artists, thanks to Oolite","Miami artists have a new opportunity to superpower their careers. Thanks to the Miami-based nonprofit Oolite Arts, four prestigious programs Anderson Ranch Arts Center, Atlantic Center for the Arts, the Rauschenberg Foundation and Yaddo will open their residencies to South Florida artists. Oolite formerly known as ArtCenter South Florida will pay stipends, tuition and travel expenses under a new program, Home and Away. ""Residencies can be a defining moment in an artist's career, offering them the time and space to experiment, in addition to creating the connections that can lead to important exhibitions and opportunities,"" said Dennis Scholl, Oolite Arts' president and CEO, in a statement. ""We hope our artists will return to South Florida with new ideas and relationships that will further enrich their own work, and Miami's cultural community."" Applications for the Anderson Ranch residency will be accepted between July 10 and Aug. 13 at oolitearts.org/homeandaway. Details about the other residencies will become available later this year.\nEach residency comes with different benefits and requirements. At Anderson Ranch, a dozen Miami artists will work and meet with master curators and artists in five-week residencies beginning in February 2020. Also next spring, Oolite will take a dozen Miami artists to Atlantic Center for the Arts in New Smyrna Beach for a weeklong residency. Artists will be chosen by a jury of local curators. One Miami artist will be chosen by jury to participate in the Rauschenberg Foundation residency at the late Robert Rauschenberg's former home in Captiva. Oolite will also support expenses for Miami artists chosen for the highly competitive Yaddo residency in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. ""Our Miami working artists are elevating their practice to a point that many of them can successfully compete for and be awarded these kinds of prestigious residencies,"" said Scholl in an interview. ""But one of the biggest issues is the economics of going off the grid for five weeks. We need to help artists pay their rent at home while they're gone."" ©2019 Miami Herald Visit Miami Herald at www.miamiherald.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.",politics,Miami Herald,left
port of l.a. sued after canceling agreement for a shipping container facility,"A Los Angeles company is suing the Port of L.A., claiming it improperly terminated an agreement to negotiate the development of a $130 million container facility at the harbor. The termination came after the company couldn't secure support for the project from the union representing dockworkers, according to the lawsuit. In a 15-page complaint filed this week in L.A. Superior Court, Harbor Performance Enhancement Center claims that it spent four years and more than $2 million on its planned facility at Terminal Island. Shipping containers were to be stored and accessed at the site, using a ""hub and spoke"" model that would ultimately ease congestion at the port. Port officials supported the project, according to the lawsuit, and granted the company an exclusive negotiating agreement. However, last month, Gene Seroka, executive director of the Port of L.A., told the company that the facility was ""infeasible."" Seroka didn't provide a reason for ending the agreement, the lawsuit states.\nThe Board of Harbor Commissioners, who are appointed by Mayor Eric Garcetti, and the Los Angeles City Council didn't weigh in on the decision, which the company claims was necessary to validate it. The lawsuit names the Port of L.A., the Board of Harbor Commissioners and the city of L.A., and asks a judge to overturn the decision. A port spokesman declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. The company's lawsuit states it started working with the port on the proposed facility in 2015. It received a permit for a pilot study, conducted an environmental review on the site and secured $130 million in financing. In 2018, Seroka told the company it also needed to get support from International Longshore and Warehouse Union, or ILWU, for the project to proceed, according to the lawsuit. The union represents more than 10,000 workers at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.\nThe company would have to guarantee to grant the union jurisdiction and exclusive rights to provide trucking services,"" according to the lawsuit. ""Rather than help mediate with the ILWU or insist that the ILWU negotiate in good faith, Executive Director Seroka, in April 2018, advised petitioners in writing that they must accommodate the ILWU's demands because 'they [ILWU] run the Port,'"" the suit states. On May 10 of this year, Seroka sent a letter to the company stating that the port was terminating its agreement. The company claims it was ""continually rebuffed"" by union representatives during discussions over the project, the lawsuit states. Jonathan Rosenthal, chief executive of Harbor Performance Enhancement Center, said in a statement to The Times that the requirements with the union were an ""unexpected curveball thrown at us."" ""Beyond the time and money we've spent, it makes me worried for the city when a green, job-creating project is stymied by a single entity for their own narrow reasons, and none of our decision makers will step in to try to resolve it,"" Rosenthal said. Leaders of the local chapter of the ILWU didn't respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit comes amid another battle at the port. The Board of Harbor Commissioners voted Thursday to approve a permit for driverless cargo handlers to operate inside a facility over the objections of the dockworkers. Los Angeles City Councilman Joe Buscaino, who represents the harbor region, said he plans to ask the council to veto the project. The container shipping company that won that permit , Maersk, has declined to say how many jobs would be affected. Times staff writer Margot Roosevelt contributed to this report. dakota.smith@latimes.com Twitter: @dakotacdsmith",science,CNN Business,left

"south african woman reunited with son six years after he disappeared and was tracked down 1,000 miles away","The pictures and footage only scratch the surface of the tale: wide smiles, and the tears of joy of a mother and her son, reunited after six years. Six years ago, Jane Daniels, 60, from Delft, near Cape Town, South Africa , was distraught when her son, who is mentally challenged, disappeared. When the police came up with no leads, after three years, Denzil was presumed dead, and a memorial service was held. But two weeks ago, police in the neighboring country of Eswatini, formerly called Swaziland, carried out a routine stop and search of a man who was found rummaging through trash outside a supermarket. He gave them an address in Delft the Daniels' home. The Eswatini police sent a photo of Denzil to the Cape police missing persons' unit, and Warrant Officer Michael Daniels no relation took it to Mrs. Daniels and asked her if she knew the man in the photo.\nBODY OF KENYAN STOWAWAY FOUND IN LONDON YARD AFTER FALLING FROM PLANE'S LANDING GEAR Officer Daniels didn't expect the reaction he received. ""My heart is going out for her. We should help this woman, because when we brought the news to say your child is in Swaziland, she just fainted,"" he said. But Mrs. Daniels couldn't afford to make the 2,200-mile round trip to collect her son, now 30, who was being looked after by the Eswatini police. Fortunately, radio and multimedia journalist Lauren Isaacs of South Africa's Eye Witness News ( EWN ) came to the rescue. A Delft pastor appealed to Isaacs for help, and the reporter visited the mother. ""I saw the desperation on her, and her poor circumstances.,"" Isaacs told Fox News. ""For three days I called businesses begging for money"". ""In 90% of missing persons cases, it doesn't end well. It gets to us, I needed to get help for this family.""

So Warrant Officer Daniels and a police colleague took vacation time, and used the policeman's private car for the two-day journey to reunite mother and son at the border.

Denzil for his part said he had hitchhiked to Eswatini where he made friends and did odd jobs to make a living. ""I helped people to earn some money, selling clothes and stuff like that... I missed my family."" He later explained to News24.com : ""I wasn't actually going to Swaziland. I was in Wellington and then I moved further and further.""

Ex-Posen mayor pleads guilty to embezzling village funds,"The former mayor of Posen pleaded guilty Thursday to embezzling $27,000 from village coffers during his final term in office. Donald Schupek, 79, who served three terms as mayor of the south suburb before losing a reelection bid in 2017, admitted under oath that in 2015 he had drawn checks on the village's bank account to give himself payroll advances that he never intended to deduct from future paychecks or repay. Prosecutors, who allege Schupek used the ill-gotten gains to gamble at casinos in Joliet, recommended a prison sentence of six and 12 months for the former mayor, who is in poor health and appeared in court Thursday using a wheelchair. By statute, U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman can sentence Schupek to as many as 10 years behind bars but the former mayor's attorney said he expects the judge to impose a much lighter sentence, possibly probation. Schupek declined comment outside the courtroom Thursday after entering his guilty plea.\nHis attorney Domingo Vargas said Schupek, who was federally indicted in January, entered the plea due to the facts of the case and his health situation. ""He'd like to put this behind him,"" Vargas said. ""He has more important issues to deal with in his life."" Vargas said his client had offered no explanation for the embezzlement, but had expressed remorse for his theft and planned to pay full restitution in hopes of receiving a lesser sentence. Schupek is scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 12. Posen's current mayor Frank Podbielniak did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Schupek. Podbielniak said at the time of Schupek's arrest in January that he learned of possible embezzlement shortly after taking office in May 2017 and immediately reported it the FBI. Schupek is the second ex-Posen mayor who has pleaded guilty to stealing from the village in the past two-plus decades.\nIn 1997, former Posen Mayor James Adamek Jr. pleaded guilty to stealing more than $180,000 from the village over 14 months and was sentenced to 15 months in prison. zkoeske@tribpub.com Twitter @ZakKoeske",crime,Chicago Tribune,center
rosemount recreation center plan gets positive response so far,"While a study on whether to proceed with a new recreation center in Rosemount continues, early results are mostly positive. In September, the Rosemount City Council hired a consultant to study the necessity of a center and how it could be funded. At a recent meeting, council members got a look at some of the early research as well as a potential design. ""We're getting a lot of feedback, most of it seems pretty positive,"" said Dan Schultz, the city's parks and recreation director. The survey is 85 percent done and should be completed in the next few weeks. The potential center would provide a place for the community to gather in recreation and wellness, according to 292 Design Group, the company selected to design it. The $28.9 million project would spread out over 87,000 square feet and feature gathering areas and office space as well as athletic facilities. WHY BUILD A REC CENTER The number of people taking part in area recreation and leisure activities is growing and there is a desire for more fitness spaces, according to the survey.\nThe population in the area is younger than the national average and there are more families with children, the survey has found. In Rosemount, 46.5 percent of households have children compared to the statewide average of 31.6 percent. ""There's needs for all ages so that would be something a facility could provide,"" Schultz said. The survey has also discovered the median household income is above average in the area. According to Schultz, this means the community has more resources to support and use the center. TENTATIVE PLAN The new recreation center would include a two-court gymnasium, two swimming pools, a locker room, an exercise area, indoor play equipment, office spaces, and a general gathering area, according to 292 Design Group. ""It reflects what was shared in meetings and at the public open house, what elements and spaces were necessary to support community activities,"" said Maria Manion, a designer with 292 Design Group.\nIts design will be made with potential expansion in mind. The costs so far do not cover the money needed to operate the facility once built. According to Schultz, it has still not been determined whether Rosemount or a private provider will fund and manage the center. ""We're still looking at those options. … We're not to that point yet to make that decision,"" he added WHAT COMES NEXT?

Ridgecrest earthquakes caused damage to the earth's crust seen from satellite,"Damage to the earth's crust from the 6.4 and 7.1 magnitude earthquakes that struck Southern California last week is visible in a kaleidoscopic satellite image released by NASA. The Advanced Rapid Imaging and Analysis team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, used satellite data to produce a map showing ruptures and displacements not visible to the naked eye employing technology that has been developed over the last quarter century. The imagery was acquired on July 8 and compared with data from April 8. The earthquakes were the largest to hit California in nearly 20 years and were felt as far away as Phoenix and Mexicali, Mexico. The temblors and the thousands of aftershocks that followed did not lead to major structural damage near the Ridgecrest epicenter, but did have residents of nearby Trona, Calif. worrying about their town's future. Authorities are investigating whether the death of a man 95 miles away in Pahrump, Nev., was tied to the earthquake.\nThe man was pinned under a Jeep after the vehicle fell off its jacks following the quake. On the NASA map, each color of the psychedelic-looking image represents 4.8 inches of ground displacement. Linear color lines indicate where an area was cracked open or was disturbed. ""One of the things that we want to know after an earthquake happens is which fault moved and how far it moved. So, by using these satellite images, we can determine where the fault is, what lengths of the fault slipped in the earthquake and which fault moved the most. That allows us to better understand where future earthquakes could happen,"" said JPL's Eric Fielding. It once took a year to obtain such satellite images, as was the case when capturing the impact of the 7.3 magnitude Landers earthquake in the Mojave Desert in 1992. But Fielding said that since 2016, images can arrive within three to four days.\nThe Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency provided the data to produce the map. NASA is building its own radar satellite at JPL. When it launches in roughly three years, Fielding said, the technology will be able to ""map the whole Earth every 12 days."" colleen.shalby@latimes.com @cshalby",science,Los Angeles Times,left
Protest in Madrid as conservatives suspend ban on most polluting cars,"MADRID (Reuters) - Thousands protested in Madrid on Saturday against the suspension of curbs on polluting cars by the new conservative city hall, raising fears that environmental rollbacks seen in the United States may be spreading to Europe. The first reversal of environmental policies by a major European city comes despite soaring global environmental concerns and is a fresh sign of growing divisions in Spain after a series of inconclusive elections in April and May. Last November Madrid's then far-left government banned most petrol and diesel cars from its center to tackle high levels of nitrogen dioxide. The policy was known as ""Madrid central"" and it was intended to bring Madrid into line with EU clean air rules which it had been violating since 2010. ""Yes we can, I do want Madrid central,"" chanted the protesters. Some were holding banners that read ""I want to breathe free"" and ""We aspire to have a Madrid without smoke"".\n""We have to save (the planet) starting at the local and small level, the first thing is Madrid's center,"" said Laura Martin, a 39-year-old actress. She added that she was concerned that the new Madrid government might have some similar ideas to U.S. President Donald Trump's rollback of environmental policies, such as weakening rules limiting carbon emissions from power plants and standards on harmful gas emissions from cars and trucks. People of all ages rallied despite a scorching heatwave in Spain and most of Europe, which had already forced the city of Paris to ban more than half of all registered cars from its roads earlier this week because the heat worsens pollution. Various European cities including Paris, Hamburg, Amsterdam, London and Oslo have started to penalize or ban older polluting cars as they seek to phase out all fossil fuel cars in the coming decade. Environmental groups including Greenpeace say the ""Madrid central"" measure slashed air pollution levels from car emissions in the center to record lows.\nThe new city hall run by the conservative People's Party suspended fines on cars entering the currently restricted area of around five sq km (two sq miles) from July 1, while it reviews the plan to make it ""compatible with citizens' mobility needs"". ""As far as I know at the European level there's no precedent in ending a car traffic restriction,"" said Lara Lazaro, researcher of the Real Instituto Elcano. The European Commission has warned Spain that it would face sanctions and a possible lawsuit if it fails to meet air quality standards in its largest cities of Madrid and Barcelona.

Missouri's only abortion clinic to remain open after judge's injunction holds,"ST. LOUIS Missouri's lone abortion clinic can still operate after a St. Louis judge on Friday kept an injunction in effect allowing it to perform the procedure. In the latest legal whiplash in the case, Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region was told minutes before a long-awaited court hearing began that the state health department had dealt it a blow, declining to renew its license. But State Circuit Court Judge Michael Stelzer ruled in favor of the embattled health center, preventing Missouri from becoming the only state in the country without an abortion clinic temporarily, at least. ""Today is a victory for women to be able to access the kind of medical care that they and their health professionals need and deserve,"" said M'Evie Mead, director of policy and organizing at Planned Parenthood Advocates in Missouri, which supports the two Planned Parenthood providers in the state, including one that no longer performs abortions.\n""It is still very, very difficult to access abortion in Missouri because of medically unnecessary hoops and regulations, but you can still come to Planned Parenthood today for all of your reproductive health care,"" Mead said. ""And that is a good day for women."" Missouri's health department first decided not to renew the health center's abortion license as of June 1 after an inspection in March found problems, including ""at least one incident in which patient safety was gravely compromised,"" ""failed surgical abortions in which women remained pregnant,"" and an alleged failure to obtain ""informed consent,"" the Associated Press reported. Stelzer granted a preliminary injunction to the clinic on June 10 that allowed it to continue to operate even as the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services refused to renew its license. He set a deadline of June 21 for the department to make a decision. Then, despite the health department not renewing the license, Stelzer said on Friday during a hearing that barely lasted five minutes that his previously issued injunction held.\nThe long-term fate of the clinic remains unclear. Stelzer said he would issue a written order regarding next steps with the injunction as soon as possible, adding it ""won't necessarily come today."" Planned Parenthood has argued that the licensing battle is part of a greater anti-abortion effort by the state's administration. Last month, Missouri's Republican Gov. Mike Parson signed a bill banning abortions on or beyond the eighth week of pregnancy without exceptions in cases of rape or incest one of the nation's most restrictive abortion bills. The clinic also says it made changes in response to the state's inspection and has consistently provided high-quality care. Its legal battle got even thornier this week when Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region announced it would no longer be complying with a rule from regulators mandating pelvic exams 72 hours before an abortion as well as on the day of the procedure, calling it another medically unnecessary requirement that the state was putting on it to whittle down Missouri residents' access to abortion.\nThat stance is backed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , which calls multiple pelvic exams for women seeking abortion ""unwarranted."" Missouri is one of six states that has only one abortion clinic. The other five states are Kentucky, Mississippi, North Dakota, South Dakota and West Virginia, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights. Missouri had more abortion clinics in the past; in 2008, there were five. But in the past decade, the clinics were unable to keep up with the state's stringent and perpetually evolving requirements, with some closing and then reopening again and then shuttering for good. The licensing fight comes amid a slew of recent anti-abortion legislation across the country, including a near-total ban on abortions in Alabama. Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union are suing to block the bans, which they say are unconstitutional under the 1973 Supreme Court Roe v.\nWade decision that federally legalized abortion.
